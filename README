import.c (adapted)                                                  (c)Ton_12-11-2010 / "profiler"
Replacement import-module for Ubuntu/Deb Homebank (v4.3) with

Added to the imported csv-file is 1 line per account containing:
            [account-number] ; [account-name as used in Homebank-wallet]
